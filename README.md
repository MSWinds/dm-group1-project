## Project Structure
The project consists of two parts:

### Part A: Classification Problem
Our tasks include developing and optimizing predictive models based on various criteria, such as accuracy, interpretability, lift for the top 30% of cases, and cost of misclassification. We also explore clustering analysis to identify potential patterns among the students.

#### Tasks:
- **Task A1:** Develop an accurate predictive model.
- **Task A2:** Generate an explanatory predictive model, preferably a Decision Tree with 4-6 rules.
- **Task A3:** Develop a predictive model focused on obtaining the highest lift for the top 30% of cases.
- **Task A4:** Construct a model taking into account the different costs associated with misclassification.
- **Task A5:** Perform clustering analysis to identify three natural groups of students based on the interval and ordinal input variables.

### Part B: Regression Problem
In this part, we work with the `DMABASE.CSV` dataset, using `LOGSALAR` as the target variable. Our tasks involve generating predictive models, performing clustering segmentation, and constructing decision trees.

#### Tasks:
- **Task B1:** Generate the 'best' predictive model using Average Square Error as the model assessment measure.
- **Task B2:** Perform clustering segmentation and provide an explanation for the clusters.
- **Task B3:** Partition the continuous variable `LOGSALAR` into three intervals and generate the best decision tree.

## Usage
Please follow the Jupyter notebooks in order for each task. Each notebook is self-contained and includes the plan, execution, and results for the task.

**Note:** In case of any discrepancies, the Jupyter notebook takes precedence.

## Contributions
All team members actively participated in developing and executing the project, contributing to different aspects such as data understanding, data preparation, model building, evaluation, and interpretation.
